👋 Hi, I’m @Alston-Choong — Assistant Professor in Sports & Exercise Medicine, Performance Science, and Sport Sociology & Anthropology, coffee‑fuelled AI‑for‑Good builder, and dragon‑boat athlete, coach & IRO.
👀 I’m interested in …
• Building a Sport‑for‑Good Foundation so every underserved, disabled or LGBTQIA+ athlete can play, excel and thrive.
• Researching environment ↔ athlete health, safeguarding, integrity & ethics, and AI/ML in sport governance, performance and health analytics.
• Turning messy sport‑health data into open dashboards, lit‑review bots and ethics audits.

🌱 I’m currently learning …
• Crafting LLM‑powered pipelines for replicable scoping/systematic reviews with NMA/MA.
• Establishing FAIR data standards for multi‑federation injury, illness & mental health registries.
• Building privacy‑first AI models that honour GDPR and athlete autonomy.
• Fine‑tuning grant‑writing copilots that clinch 🥇 on reviewer scorecards.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on …
• Sport‑for‑Good pilots → I bring medical expertise, impact evaluation & a DEI lens; seeking private corporations committed to corporate social justice.
• Ethical AI in sport → I bring LLM fine‑tuning & clinical validation; looking for data engineers/scientists & sport ethicists.
• Sports DEI policy for LGBTQIA+ → I craft inclusive, ethical, evidence‑based gender‑verification policies (esp. for transwomen athletes); seeking transgender athletes & researchers with the same interest.
• Global policy briefs → I synthesise evidence & navigate stakeholder diplomacy; keen to co‑author with scholars from under‑represented regions worldwide.

🛠️ Tech & Language Toolbox …
• Programming & analysis: R, Python, SPSS, NVivo, GPower, etc 
• Human languages: English, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), Malay, French (intermediate), German (beginner), Spanish (beginner)
